# winter-escape
my game for the pygame community spring game jam 2023

Game was created using pygame-ce 2.2.1 (SDL 2.26.4, Python 3.9.9)
Additional libraries: `json`, `math`, `time` libraries

# How to run the game?
Use the command terminal, to run the main.py file by typing: `python3.9 main.py` in the terminal.

If you get an error, stating that "pygame doesn't have ..." something something, check your pygame-ce version. This game uses FRects, so pygame-ce >2.2.0 is required (or when FRects were added lol)

# When was it made?
This game was made for pygame community spring jam 2023
